## Hello! 👋

Our school has gone through a number of name changes.

It's now called [Florida Ruffin Ridley School][] and the new GitHub org is https://github.com/ruffinridleyschool

[Florida Ruffin Ridley School]: https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/ruffinridley

Before that, for a couple years, the school was known as Coolidge Corner School (CCS). Before that, for many years, it was known as the Edward Devotion School or "Devo" for short.
